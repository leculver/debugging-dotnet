    "# Investigating Blocked or Slow Finalizers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will walk through how to debug finalizers that are slow, long running, or blocked.  This is sometimes the root cause of memory leaks or excess memory usage in a C# application, so it's important to understand how to debug when this is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finalizers and the finalizer queue\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Finalizer Queue\" in the .Net Runtime processes finalizable objects after the GC has identified that the object is no longer reachable.  This is done on a deticated thread called the \"Finalizer Thread\".  There is only ever one finalizer thread processing finalizable objects.  This means that if a process ever creates finalizable objects faster than they can be processed by the FinalizerQueue, your process will eventually run out of memory.  This isn't a \"memory leak\" in the traditional sense, as the .Net Runtime knows where all of that memory is.  It's trying to clean up that memory as quickly as possible, but isn't able to keep up with demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a refresher, finalizers are defined in C# code as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` C#\n",
    "class Foo\n",
    "{\n",
    "    ~Foo()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // This is a finalizer, it will be executed on a finalizer thread.\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## In the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will be taking a look at a finalizer that is fully blocked.  We've caused a deadlock by taking a monitor and never releasing it.  This is the easiest way to make sure our scenario is easy to debug and understand.  Keep in mind that even just having *slow* code in a finalizer can lead to a problem if too many objects of that type are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have seen issues where finalizers caused excess memory usage in the process due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Blocked threads, such as a finalizer trying to take a lock held by another thread.\n",
    "2. Async operations like a network operation, or file IO that takes a long time to complete.\n",
    "3. Attempting to call into an STA apartment (like the UI thread) from a finalizer.\n",
    "4. Extensive retry code (especially for network operations).\n",
    "5. Or just any kind of long-running operation that is occurring on the finalizer thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical advice for avoiding these problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Where possible, these kinds of problems can be avoided using the `Dispose()` pattern.  Classes with finalizers should implement `IDisposable` and be used with a `using` statement to clean up any state.  This is the canonical example of a disposable/finalizable class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C#\n",
    "    public class DisposableResource : IDisposable\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // Flag to detect redundant calls\n",
    "        private bool _disposed = false;\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Public method to use the resource\n",
    "        public void UseResource()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            if (_disposed)\n",
    "                throw new ObjectDisposedException(\"DisposableResource\");\n",
    "\n",
    "            Console.WriteLine(\"Using the resource.\");\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Implement IDisposable\n",
    "        public void Dispose()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            Dispose(true);\n",
    "            // Be sure to suppress finalization:\n",
    "            GC.SuppressFinalize(this);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Protected implementation of Dispose pattern\n",
    "        protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            if (!_disposed)\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                if (disposing)\n",
    "                {\n",
    "                    // Clean up managed objects.  That means if this class holds other IDiposable objects,\n",
    "                    // call their Dispose() methods here.  Note that \"cleaning up\" does not mean assigning\n",
    "                    // it's fields to null, which I often see.  You can do that if you want, or have a\n",
    "                    // reason to do so, but we mean calling Dispose on other objects in this block.\n",
    "                }\n",
    "\n",
    "                // Clean up native objects and memory.\n",
    "                // For example, calling out to release native resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "                _disposed = true;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Finalizer\n",
    "        ~DisposableResource()\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.\n",
    "            Dispose(false);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing this pattern ensures that we efficiently clean up everything when `Dispose` is called on the thread using the object.  This means the finalizer thread will never have to process it, avoiding the problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, some libraries you use may not properly implement this pattern, sometimes what you are implementing doesn't neatly translate to that pattern, and sometimes it's simply not possible to call `Dispose` in certain circumstances even when we know it would be better to do so.  The rest of this document explains how we go about debugging and investigating something like this goes wrong.\n",

Any objects which the GC collects and are determined ready for finalization will now never disappear from the heap.

For example, in [BlockedFinalizer.cs](../BlockedFinalizer/BlockedFinalizer.cs), the list and objects contained in `BlockedFinalizer._list` cannot ever be swept by the GC.  At least, not until the finalizer for each `BlockedFinalizer` completes (which it never will in this example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is a synthetic and simple example as it's very rare to simply deadlock on the Finalizer thread.  However, this is similar enough to many real root causes of failures that we have investigated in the past that it will serve as a good example of how to debug this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The !FinalizeQueue command\n",
    "\n",
    "SOS offers a `!FinalizeQueue` command to inspect finalizable objects.  The standard `!FinalizeQueue` command will search the entire GC heap for objects that are finalizable.  The base command does *not* list objects that are \"ready\" for finalization, only that these objects will eventually be finalized when they are no longer referenced if `GC.SuppressFinalize` is not called on them.  By default, this command will list out every individual object, so we will just ask for a summary of objects with the `-stat` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see below, we have 999 `BlockedFinalizer` objects that it found to be finalizable.  We allocated 1000, but one of them is already being processed by the finalizer thread, so it's actually no longer a 'finalizable' object by the time we inspect the heap here.  We also see several other objects that are used by the .Net Runtime and its standard library for various purposes.  This is all normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, again, that this is a mix of both 'live' and 'dead' objects that are currently on the heap.  The 'dead' finalizable objects will only be cleaned up when a GC is performed and locates them, then their finalizer method is called by the finalizer thread.  (There are other caveats here, like resurrection that are beyond the scope of this document.)\n",

    "## Root causing 'excess memory'\n",
    "\n",
    "Having too many objects 'ready' for finalization can lead to excess memory in your program.  The most common symptom here is increased managed or native memory, depending on what objects are building up that can't make it through the finalizer queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive further into debugging the issue, it's important to stop here and take stock of this state.  In our contrived example, we have blocked the finalizer queue and in the next sections we will explore how to see that.  However, in many real world scenarios we don't have to have a fully *blocked* finalizer thread in order to see this scenario.  The most common way this issue manifests itself is \"slow\" finalizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you create 25 finalizable objects per minute which eventually reach the finalizer queue (instead of being disposed of with the `IDisposable` interface/pattern).  Let's say that each of those objects takes 50 milliseconds to do some expensive cleanup operation.  This means that the finalizer thread can clean up ~20 of those objects per second.  Your process will be generating objects faster than they can be cleaned up.  The finalizer thread isn't *blocked* in this scenario, it eventually cleans up each individual object.  What's worse, you might have randomly paused the process to take a crash dump when a *different* object was being processed by the finalizer, which can be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "When root causing this kind of issue (whether it's a blocked or 'slow' finalizer), it's important to simply take a look at the number of objects 'ready' for finalization and see if that number is increasing over time.  This typically means taking multiple crash dumps of the same process as your memory continues to grow.  Even if you don't have a series of crash dumps to compare, knowing what objects are ready for finalization and checking if that number seems abnormally large is a good idea to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the finalizer thread\n",
    "\n",
    "While it can sometimes be misleading, it's a good idea to check and see what the finalizer thread is doing.  For that, we'll simply use the `!clrthreads` command in SOS, which gives us the managed view of threads in the process.  This command will not list out any thread where we have never run managed code before.  The `DBG` column tells us what the debugger calls that thread.  The `ID` column is the managed thread id (not useful to us in this case), and the `OSID` is what the operating system calls this thread.  Certain special threads, such as the finalizer, have a marker at the end to tell us what it is.  In this case we are looking for the `(Finalizer)` marker.  Below, you will see that thread 6 (OSID e6d8) is our finalizer thread."

If the finalizer is \"asleep\", waiting for work to do we would see the `coreclr!FinalizerThread::WaitForFinalizerEvent` frame instead.  Second, it is processing our `BlockedFinalizer` object, and `BlockedFinalizer` is attempting to take a lock with `coreclr!JIT_MonReliableEnter_Portable` and `coreclr!Object::EnterObjMonitor`.  Third, we can see that we are blocking the thread because we are in a wait call `coreclr!CLREventBase::Wait` and similar frames.\n",

In this case it would show `BlockedFinalizer.Finalize` and that we are entering a monitor, but not the native frames that explicitly tell us whether the finalizer queue is sleeping or awake.  However, you can mostly infer that from whether any object has its Finalize method on the stack."

    "\n",
    ".Net Runtime implementation details:  We can lock almost any object in .Net, and that information has to be held somewhere.  We keep a table of extra data that can be optionally associated with objects called the \"SyncBlock Table\".  Only objects which *need* extra data associated with them get a SyncBlock table entry allocated to them.  When you use the `lock` keyword (or `Monitor` class), we typically do not allocate a SyncBlock to the object if there is no contention.  Each object has an \"object header\", and part of that header is used for a low overhead spin-lock if there is no contention.  When two or more threads attempt to lock the same object, this spin-lock may be upgraded into a full lock, which is one of the things we track with the `SyncBlock` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the `!syncblk` command only shows locks which have been upgraded to full SyncBlock table entries that are currently held by a thread.  You can use `!syncblk -all` to see the full table.  As you can see below, the lock is held by thread `6c50`, which is correct.  You can see the callstack of that thread by swapping over to that thread with `~~[6c50]s` followed by `k`.  Or you can execute a command on a thread with the `e` postfix.  In this case, we'll just look at the managed stack on that thread with `!clrstack` by using `~~[6c50]e !clrstack`, showing the managed stack of thread 6c50."
